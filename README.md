This repository contains my personal [kata02 Karate Chop](http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/) implementation.

For this kata I would like to include the though process involved while doing it (briefly).

#### entry 01

After reading the kata, I though oh ok! a binary search, but with five different implementations!.

Taking into account that I'll do it on Go I tried to think some possible implementations, I've got the following:

- Basic.
- Using concurrency (idiomatic one).
- Interface ready.
- Concurrent (using Mutexes) - not totally sure about this one. 
- Recursive - not something I would normally do (in Go).
